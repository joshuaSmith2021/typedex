A simple [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) application that uses [PokeApi](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) and its Python 3 wrapper,
[Pokebase](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokebase) to show Pokemon and their in-game weaknesses/resistances. Just a fun little
project of mine to gain experience with Flask/Full stack Python. When running it, set the FLASK_APP to main.py.

Aside from Flask of cource, its only dependency is pokebase, which is super easy to install. Just use
`pip install pokebase`
